# Employee Summary Engine
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red)
### Description
For this project I created multiple javascript classes that each represented a type of employee that will be added to the system. Every employee (engineer, intern, manager) has a prompt for name, id, and email. They also have specific prompts for each job position.  The application uses multiple HTML templates to write the unique data entered in the terminal when the application is run. Once the user is finished entering employees' data into the terminal, they can select the 'build team' option that will automatically generate a HTML document with all the data written onto it.

### Installation
Select app.js from the explorer. Right click app.js and open the integrated terminal. Once the terminal launches, type 'node app.js'. This command will then prompt the user to enter in specifics for their employees. Type in the information for each employee and then hit enter to save the data and return to the main menu. Once all employees are entered, use the arrow keys to select 'build team'. Hit enter to create a HTML file in the outputs folder. This file can be launched in the browser and will display the front end of the application with all the new employees written onto the page.
